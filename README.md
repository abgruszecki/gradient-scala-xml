# Gradient: migrated `scala-xml` code
This is a supplementary repository for the
"Gradient: Gradual Compartmentalization via Object Capabilities" paper,
accepted at OOPSLA 2024. 

It contains the code of the standard [Scala XML](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml) library,
migrated to the gradual compartmentalization Scala extension proposed in the paper.
The README file of Scala XML was moved [here](./scala-xml-readme.md).

The report describing how the code was migrated and how it can be verified
is located [here](./report.md)
